# CO2-Prediction-
In this project , on Weather-dataset, i implemented ML models to predict CO2 quantity and classify the occupancy based on CO2 and solar light quantity.

these are the tasks implemented on this dataset : 
## Part 1 :
1. Build a mathematical model of linear regression (from scratch) for predicting CO2 emissions based on 'Temperature', 'Humidity', 'Light', and 'HumidityRatio'
## Part 2 : 
2. Build a mathematical model of logistic regression for binary classification of 'Occupancy' based on 'CO2' and 'Light';
3. Plot the decision boundary.
4.	Build a mathematical model of logistic regression for binary classification of 'Occupancy' based on 'Temperature', 'Humidity', 'Light', 'CO2', and 'HumidityRatio'.
